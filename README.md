# Visual Proofs 

## 1. Project's Description
Visual Proofs is all about conceptualizing mathematics visually. The validity of many mathematical statements or identities
can be fully proven, throughout diagramms or pictures as a self-evident proof, usually not accompanied by an explanatory text.
So Visual Proofs mission is about making these proofs and this way of mathematical logic more accessible.
