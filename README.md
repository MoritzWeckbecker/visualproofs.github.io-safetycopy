## 1. Project's Description
Visual Proofs is all about conceptualizing mathematics visually. The validity of many mathematical statements or identities
can be fully proven, throughout diagramms or pictures as a self-evident proof, usually not accompanied by an explanatory text.
So Visual Proofs mission is about making these proofs and this way of mathematical logic more accessible.

## 2. How to Contribute to the Project

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### i. Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. So, therefore to report bugs, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
- If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information.

### ii. Suggesting Enhancement
This subsection walks you through submitting an improvement suggestion for Visual Proofs, which might be a completely new feature or just minor improvements to existing features.

Check the following list out, to make sure your suggestion is complete:
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. 
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Visual Proofs which the suggestion is related to.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Visual Proof readers.

<a name="subs"></a>
### iii. Code Submission
Whether it is new proofs or extending existing ones, expansion of the website is always welcomed.

**There are a few things one should keep in mind before submitting a new proof:**
- The general post-theme should be preserved 
  - The content structure of posts should be maintained
  - The pictures and diagramms included should be a good representative of the topic
- The mathematical correctness of the proof
- The interactive part of the proof

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to VisualProofs with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)).

## 3. References for the Proofs
The implemented proofs were inspired by the following references. Feel free to find something interesting there, which you would want to feature on Visual Proofs
