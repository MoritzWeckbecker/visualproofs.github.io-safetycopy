The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental and certainly well-known geometric theorem. According to this theorem, if we are dealing with a right-angled triangle, then the hypotenuse is equal to the square root of the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. The equation to describe this theorem, given the pre-said condition is: 

<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow>
    <msup>
      <mi>a</mi>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </msup>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <msup>
      <mi>b</mi>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </msup>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <msup>
      <mi>c</mi>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </msup>
  </mrow>
</math>

where a and b represent the cathetuses, otherwise known as the legs adjacent or opposite-sided of the right angle and c is the hypotenuse.

This theorem has a wide-set of application including engineering and construction fields, face recognition in security cameras, navigation etc...

When a triangle has a right angle (90Â°) and squares are made on each of the three sides, then the biggest square has the exact same area as the other two squares put together!

Play around with a and b to see how and why this theory holds:
