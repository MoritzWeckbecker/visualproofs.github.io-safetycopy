Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) is acknowledged as one of the most influential mathematicians of all time. His contribution includes not 
only fields of mathematics, but physics and statistics as well. His strong mathematical intuition was to be noticed from an early age, where 
allegedly as a school boy he came up with the below written formula , which we know as Gauss summation, to sum up n-integers.

<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow>
    <munderover>
      <mo>âˆ‘</mo>
      <mrow>
        <mi>i</mi>
        <mo>=</mo>
        <mn>1</mn>
      </mrow>
      <mi>n</mi>
    </munderover>
    <mi>i</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mfrac>
      <mrow>
        <mi>n</mi>
        <mo>*</mo>
        <mrow>
          <mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo>
          <mi>n</mi>
          <mo>+</mo>
          <mn>1</mn>
          <mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo>
        </mrow>
      </mrow>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </mfrac>
  </mrow>
</math>

That this formula holds can be visually proven with y-axis being of length n and x-axis of length n+1. The amount of the black squares represents the sum of n-integers.

Use the slider below to test it for different n-values.
